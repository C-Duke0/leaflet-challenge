## Background

The United States Geological Survey is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

## Overview

This project fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program and visualizes it on a map. The size of the data markers represents the magnitude of the earthquakes, and the color represents their depth. Clicking on a marker provides more details about the earthquake.

## Features

- Interactive map using Leaflet.js
- Data markers that vary in size based on earthquake magnitude
- Data markers that vary in color based on earthquake depth
- Popups with additional information for each earthquake
- A legend explaining the color coding for depth

## Technologies Used

- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
